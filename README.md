## Notes

If any issues are encountered, try using the versions listed above, which were used at the time of writing. In particular, note that
[oat_python](https://github.com/OpenAppliedTopology/oat_python) had been recently released at the time of writing, and may be updated
in the future.

The file timds.py contains necessary functions, and is needed to run the example notebooks.

The data are not included in this repository, and need to be downloaded separately using the links above.
